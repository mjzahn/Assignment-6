  abstract    = "Computers are a central tool in the research process, enabling
                 complex and large scale data analysis. As computer-based
                 research has increased in complexity, so have the challenges
                 of ensuring that this research is reproducible. To address
                 this challenge, we review the concept of the research
                 compendium as a solution for providing a standard and easily
                 recognisable way for organising the digital materials of a
                 research project to enable other researchers to inspect,
                 reproduce, and extend the research. We investigate how the
                 structure and tooling of software packages of the R
                 programming language are being used to produce research
                 compendia in a variety of disciplines. We also describe how
                 software engineering tools and services are being used by
                 researchers to streamline working with research compendia.
                 Using real-world examples, we show how researchers can improve
                 the reproducibility of their work using research compendia
                 based on R packages and related tools.",
